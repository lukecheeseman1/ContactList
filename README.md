Introduction
This Project is created for a module in college called Data representation and querying. The project requires us to create a single page application. We had to use the M.E.A.N stack to create this application. For my project I wanted to create a easy to use simple phone book application.
The website I have created is intended to take in a first name, second name, and number. You also are able to delete a contact from the database. 
Single Page Application explained
A SPA is an application that runs inside a browser (or in a “compatible” environment) and does not require page reloading during use. You can think of a SPA as a thick client that is loaded from a web server. You most likely have already used this type of application: Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, iCloud, GitHub, Hotmail, Soundcloud, or Trello are common SPAs.
SPAs are all about providing an outstanding user experience by trying to replicate a “native” environment in the browser – no page reloads, no extra wait time.
Creating the website
To create this website I decided id look up similar projects and see how they connected to databases, and how they deleted or updated or selected data. Wanted to make the app with Angular and do all installations through node command prompt. Using NPM.
Angular 4 
AngularJS (commonly referred to as "Angular.js" or "AngularJS 1.X") is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications.
When AngularJS starts your application, it parses and processes this new markup from the template using the compiler. The loaded, transformed and rendered DOM is then called the view. The first kind of new markup are the directives. They apply special behavior to attributes or elements in the HTML.
MongoDB/mLAB
I decided to use Mongodb and used a method of creating a repository db folder in my c: drive. I seemed to get allot of errors for some reason so changed db to a mlab link. I had issues with connecting mongo.
Express
Express 3.x is a light-weight web application framework to help organize your web application into an MVC architecture on the server side. You can use a variety of choices for your templating language (like EJS, Jade, CORS, and Dust.js).
Node
Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
